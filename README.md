# dotfiles

Or something of that shape.

Going to borrow inspiration from https://github.com/mtaron/dotfiles.

But to start, setting up my machine.

## Usage

On a fresh machine:

```
# Install Homebrew
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
brew install git

# Install rest of apps, tools
git clone https://github.com/erichmusick/dotfiles.git "$HOME/dotfiles"
brew bundle

# TODO
```
